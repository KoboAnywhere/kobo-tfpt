# Trigger file page turner and rotation control for Kobo

This plugin allows us to turn pages and trigger rotation events in Nickel using trigger files.

This plugin isn't meant for regular users and, for the most part, is only used in the KoboAnywhere project to map the input events of ported devices to Nickel actions.

## Building from source

`make` builds the shared library, `libtfpt.so`, which can be installed in
/usr/local/Kobo/imageformats.
